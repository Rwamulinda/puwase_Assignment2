 Guess the number assignment 
This program is a "Guess the Number" game where the program tries to guess a number picked by the user between 1 and a specified range (default is 1 to 100). The program will adjust its guess based on the user's feedback, which indicates if the actual number is higher or lower than the guess.

Instructions
it starts by asking a user to think of a number between 1 and 100.

The program will make a guess using while loop and if condition to check the correct response.

You can respond with:

H if the actual number is higher than the program's guess.
L if the actual number is lower than the program's guess.
= if the guess is correct.
The program will terminate once the correct number is guessed, and it will display how many guesses were made.
And once a user type something that is not H,L or = the program will inform the user that incorrect answer and ask yo typr the right choice
