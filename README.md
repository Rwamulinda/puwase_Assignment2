 Guess the number assignment 
This program is a simple "Guess the Number" game where the program tries to guess a number picked by the user between 1 and a specified range (default is 1 to 100). The program will adjust its guess based on the user's feedback, which indicates if the actual number is higher or lower than the guess.

Instructions
Think of a number between 1 and 100 (or the defined range).

The program will make a guess.

You can respond with:

H if the actual number is higher than the program's guess.
L if the actual number is lower than the program's guess.
= if the guess is correct.
The program will terminate once the correct number is guessed, and it will display how many guesses were made.
I used while loop and if condition.
